HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT


By:- Sanjay Raveendran Pullithadathil (24BTCSESE09)

Description:- 
My website is mainly accountable for a hospital branch where they have multiple hospitals around the state, country, or even around the globe.
The main page of the web page contains the ADMIN tab, Doctor tab and Patient tab, which will lead to their respective web pages.
For both Doctor and Host page, there is a sign in page and for Patient page there is both sign in and sign up(for new users).
In the ADMIN page there is an entire database of the hospital which contains all doctors and their department. The admin can modify the database by adding, removing or altering the doctors or the departments.
In the Patient page, users can see all the departments and doctors working in that department, and most importantly they can book an appointment with their favourable doctor.
In the Doctor page, doctors can see their upcoming shift and see all appointments, which allows them to properly plan when to finalize timings for patients appointments.

Problem Statement:-

We encountered many online hospital applications and websites, but none of them didn’t reach to user’s expectation or aren’t properly up to the present date.

The patient can rate the Doctor and the Hospital, which allows them to understand whether to improve or not.
Existing Application:-

The ideas are almost like from a swiggy application where users can select their respective doctor and they can rate them.

Uniqueness of Project:-

My project mainly focuses on user satisfaction and patient satisfaction.
There is not a single project which is closer to user needs and satisfaction.

TOOLS & Software used:-

We used MERN stack for this project which includes:-

Frontend side:- REACT JS, CSS For designing.
Using API tools such as POSTMAN,Bruno.
Using MongoDB as the database management system.
BACKend server we use node js. 

Conclusion:-
 
The HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT System is built using MERN Stack which provides an efficient, scalable, and user friendly solution for managing both the doctor and patients database. It is user-friendly and built for the present world.
